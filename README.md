List of some multicast groups and corresponding ports. Hopefully, this will save someone the time of having to type this stuff in  themselves.  
  * NOTE - This is an incomplete list. I've provided the documentation below, If you don't see what you're looking for in any of the coded dictionaries - you SHOULD find what you're looking for in those docs.
  * NOTE - this is US Markets Centric.

# TODO
add more multicast addresses.  Our current list is a good start, however, I don't have the replays and a number of other products. Additionally, I'd like to see non-US market data ported into this as well.   

# How to use it
<pre>

import socket
import os
import sys
import multicast_ip_list

 
 # pass in the interface name you're testing against and the list (the dictionary name)
 def goMulticast(INTERFACEIP, LIST):
    DEBUG=0
    if(LIST=="CQSaddressportsA"):
        getit=multicast_ip_list.CQSaddressportsA
    elif(LIST=="OTCaddressportsA"):
        getit=multicast_ip_list.OTCaddressportsA
    else:
        print("can not find "+LIST)
        exit(1)

    # traverse all the multicast groups and ports
    for MCAST_GRP,MCAST_PORT in getit.items():
        if(DEBUG==1):
            print(MCAST_GRP+" "+str(MCAST_PORT)+" "+INTERFACEIP)
 
        #  joinMcast is a function that takes the multicast group, port and local interface ip address and makes a socket connection
        sock=joinMcast(MCAST_GRP,MCAST_PORT,INTERFACEIP)
        sock.settimeout(10)
        try:
            # read data from the feed
            sock.recv(10240)
            sock.close()
        except:
            # uh-oh - the read failed or timed out.  print which group/port/list failed
            print("failed reading group "+MCAST_GRP+ " on port "+str(MCAST_PORT)+" and interface: "+INTERFACEIP+" ("+LIST+")")
 
</pre>
